# go-utils

The purpose of this project is to test Go's public package :)

I integrated some of the data structures APIs from JavaScript into this project.
So, If you are familiar with JavaScript, you can easily understand the code and use it in your project.


## Installation

```bash

go get github.com/lesenelir/go-utils

```

## Thank you
To all of you: Thank you for using this package. I hope it helps you in your project.
